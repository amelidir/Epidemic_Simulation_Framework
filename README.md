# Epidemic_Simulation_Framework
Epidemic Simulation is an open-source project that lets you visualize and experiment with how viruses spread. By adjusting factors like infection rates and recovery times, you can create different epidemic scenarios. Watch the virus spread in real-time and see how interventions like quarantine and vaccination can make a difference. It's a tool for learning about public health and the importance of individual actions. Built in Python, it's available on GitHub for anyone to use or contribute to.
